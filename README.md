## Hello there, I'm Tyler

I am a current student at Western Governor's University. I began the Information Technology program in October of 2023. In my professional life, I am currently a Loan Officer and the IT/Security Advocate for the Bank of Frankewing - 
Hazel Green. I have a passion for cybersecurity, and I plan to use this platform to document my studies, projects, and other interests.
